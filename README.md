“On the Robustness of Determining the Mass of a Planet from Her Atmospheric Scale Height with Synthetic JWST Data”
Author: Jasper van der Hammen
Period of Work: April 1st – July 8th, 2025

Overview
The goal of this project is to assess the reliability of retrieving a planet’s mass from its atmospheric scale height using synthetic data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This is achieved through a structured pipeline consisting of forward modeling, error simulation via PandExo, rebinning, and parameter fitting, with interactive visualisation through a GUI.

Repository Structure and Methodology
forwardmodel.py
Constructs the forward model of the planetary spectrum.
Output: Spectrum_datainformation.txt — a file containing the generated spectral data and relevant metadata.

pandexo_Spectrums/
This folder contains the outputs generated by PandExo, which is used to simulate JWST observational noise and compute relative uncertainties.

rebinning.py
Rebins the synthetic spectrum to match the instrument's resolution and signal-to-noise characteristics.
Output: outputDATAINFORMATION.txt, which contains the processed data used for the fitting procedures. Please note the notation of Y, YY and N to correspond to a top cloud pressure of 1e-3, 5e-3 and None respectively

gui.py
Provides a graphical user interface that allows for:

Overplotting the model and observational data.

Executing the full parameter fitting routine via the "BATCH" button (note: this process takes approximately 1–2 days for all nine datasets).

Exploring fit results and confidence intervals via the "PROGRESS" button, showing the $\sigma$ confidence plots presented in the thesis.

Notes
The BATCH fitting procedure only needs to be executed once. Upon completion, the results are saved and can be accessed at any time through the GUI.

The entire pipeline is designed to be reproducible, allowing future improvements or alternative model testing.
